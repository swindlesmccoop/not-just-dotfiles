The goal of this project is to both make using a UNIX-based/like system both intuitive and comfortable, while making sure everything is simple, easily maintainable, customizable, and replacable, without having to go through all of the hassle of configuring every single program used every single time I start using a new computer.

List of required packages coming soon.
