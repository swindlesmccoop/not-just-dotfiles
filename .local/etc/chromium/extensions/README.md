# How to Use
1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable Developer Mode
3. Clone the repo of any of the extensions you want to enable
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Navigate into the clone directory of the extension you want to load. Note: some extensions may have the actual extension code inside of something like `src/`. As long as the folder you select has a file named `manifest.json`, you should be able to use it just fine.
5a. If loading the extension fails, zip up the folder containing the `manifest.json` and rename the extension to `.crx`. Then, load the packed extension.

# List of extensions and their functions
## Audio-only YouTube
Doesn't even download the video from YouTube, just streams the audio

## AutoScroll
Used for middle mouse button scrolling on Linux and Mac

## Buster
Bypasses Google Captchas a lot of the time

## Chromium Web Store
Allows you to download extensions from the Chrome Web Store on my preferred browser, Ungoogled Chromium

## ClearURLs
Removes all of the bloat and tracking from URLs

## Dark Reader
Makes most pages dark in a way that doesn't inhibit your ability to read the content. Usually disabled if I'm using 4chan since I can easily change my styles on there.

## KeePassXC
You need to install this directly from the Chrome Store, since if you download the source code and run it, it will have a different extension ID from what the actual program is looking for

## LocalCDN
Prevents tracking through CDNs

## Search by Image
Right click on an image and find the source

## Stylus
Custom CSS on any webpage you desire

## uBlock Origin
Lightweight Ad Blocker and some other stuff included with it

## Universal Bypass
Bypasses stupid link shorteners that make you watch ads like AdFly

## User Agent Switcher
See the Windows and Mac versions of websites and whatnot. You can change your UA to be something much more generic than your actual system to prevent tracking.

## Vimium
Vim navigation in the browser. I probably am greatful for this more than any of the other ones here.

## ViolentMonkey
Loads userscripts like those from GreasyFork. I use this to load 4chanX and OneeChan.

## WebRTC Leak Prevent Toggle
Prevent people from seeing my local IP address, even if I'm on a VPN
